HOOP! 🤘🏾
My name is Edilson Pacheco. Currently i'm living in São Paulo, Brazil and working with front-end development. 
Since i've been learned to write my first functional line of code, i turn myself a lover of technologies and all ecosystem wrapped around them.

I like to play drums and guitar, it's a nice therapy! 🎸 🥁

My heros is Jesus, my father, Spider-Man/Peter Parker and Jimi Hendrix, that's all! ✌🏾 🙌🏾
